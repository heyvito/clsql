**clsql** provides a toolchain to work with databases and SQL for Clojure
applications.<br/>
It provides facilities to work with migrations and queries, allowing teams to
have reproducible migrations and easier to maintain queries, leaving SQL out
of Clojure.

## Reasoning
Clojure is a great tool to build DSLs, that's clear to every Clojure developer.
But maintaining raw SQL within Clojure can lead to cluttered code, and using
DSLs for such can make learning curves for new team members steeper, or
introduce hard-to-find bugs. For those reasons, **clsql** was built.

This library is heavily inspired by some of
[yesql](https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql) features.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

```clojure
[clsql "0.3.0"]
```

### Dependencies

**clsql** does not provide abstractions to SQL. It simply parses files in a
predetermined format, in a set of directories following a [convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
approach, and wraps contents and annotations of those files into Clojure
functions. In order to access a database, you will need a **driver**:

|  Database  | Driver                                       |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL | `[org.postgresql/postgresql "42.2.12.jre7"]` |

> **Notice**: Currently, this library has been tested exclusively with PostgreSQL.
In case you use another RDBMS, feel free to test it and open a pull request to
update this table.


## Usage

As mentioned previously, `clsql` handles both migrations and queries. Developers
are free to use only a single facility, or both of them.

### Initial configuration
Library defaults can be changed by changing
[`atom`](https://clojure.org/reference/atoms)s defined by the `clsql.config`
namespace:

| Atom                     | Required By         | Description   |
|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| `migrations-directory`   | Migrations          | Indicates the directory in which the library will look for migration files. Defaults to `"resources/db/migrations"` |
| `queries-directory`      | Querying            | Indicates the directory in which the library will look for query files. Defaults to `"resources/db/queries"`|
| `database-configuration` | Migrations/Querying | Defines configurations to connect to the target database server. |

`database-configuration` is required by both facilities. It is required for
querying if you intend to use the simpler, non-star query functions. For further
information, refer to [Passing Extra Options](#Passing-Extra-Options)

### Migrations
In order to use any feature provided by the Migrations facility, your
application's entrypoint must be updated to give control over to `clsql` to
perform command-line parsing and execute any required operation. For such,
check the snippet below:

```clojure
(ns myapplication.core)

(defn- configure-clsql []
    (reset! clsql.config/migrations-directory "./another/directory"))

(defn -main []
  (configure-clsql)
  (when-not (clsql.cli-handler/handle-command-line-args)
    (comment Your Application initialisation procedures goes here)))
```

> **ProTipâ„¢**: Execute any modifications to the library's configuration options
prior to calling `handle-command-line-args`.

`handle-command-line-args` will return `false` in case it could not detect
any operation request. The following operations can be executed:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `create-migration NAME` | Creates a new migration stub in the configured `migrations-directory`. `NAME` can only contain letters (A-Za-z), numbers (0-9) and dashes (-) |
| `db-migrate` | Executes every pending migration |
| `db-rollback` | Rolls-back the database by executing the `down` section of the last migration. |
| `db-rollback VERSION` | Rolls-back the database by executing the `down` section of every migration created after `VERSION` |
| `db-migration-status` | Displays a table listing all migrations and their respective statuses |

#### Working with Migrations
Each migration created with `create-migration` is composed by two sections:
`up` and `down`.
`up` is required, and must contain every SQL command needed to migrate your
database to the next version.
`down` is optional. When defined, it must contain every SQL command needed to
revert changes made by `up`. When undefined, a migration will be considered
irreversible. Trying to rollback it will result in an error, indicating that
it cannot be reversed. Below you can find a migration example:

```sql
-- This creates a new `users` table.
-- Notice: Comments are allowed anywhere. The only thing clsql cares about
-- is region separators, indicated with `--;; <region>`, where `<region>`
-- may be `up` or `down`.

--;; up
CREATE TABLE users
    (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR NOT NULL, -- We're allowing comments to be here as well.
     email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE);

--
-- This is another comment, between regions.
--

--;; down
DROP TABLE users;
```

#### Migration safety
Migrations are executed within a transaction. This way, in case anything goes
wrong, all changes will be automatically reverted.

> **WARNING**: Not every RDBMS accepts schema modifications within transactions.

### Queries

Plain SQL files defines queries where each file may contain an arbitrary number
of queries. Each query must contain at least a name, but can also include
additional information, such as a documentation, and modifiers.

#### Defining queries

To define queries, first ensure the directory configured by
[`clsql.config/queries-directory`](#initial-configuration) exists. Then, create
a new file, for examples here, assume a file named `users.sql`. Then, define a
new query by prefixing it with a name:

```sql
--> active-users
```

Names must be indicated by the `-->` prefix, followed by how one wants to
reference the query on Clojure's side. In the example above, an `active-users`
query will be defined. After adding documentation, the same query can be
represented by the following snippet:

```sql
--> active-users
-- Returns all users marked as active.
-- Users are marked as active after confirming their email addresses.
```

The code above allows the library to automatically include documentation
to generated functions, making them available through [`doc`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.repl/doc).

Then, write your SQL as you would:

```sql
--> active-users
-- Returns all users marked as active.
-- Users are marked as active after confirming their email addresses.
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE activated_at IS NOT NULL
```

#### Importing queries

After configuring and defining your SQL, simply import it by using
`require-query` or `require-queries`:

```clojure
(ns myapplication.some-namespace
    :require [clsql.core :refer [require-query]])

(require-query users :refer [active-users])

(defn list-active-users []
    (active-users))
```

The result will be a list of maps of all returned results.

In the REPL, documentation can be also accessed:

```clojure
=> (doc active-users)
-------------------------
myapplication.some-namespace/active-users
([& args*])
  Returns all users marked as active. Users are marked as active after
  confirming their email addresses.

  Arguments
  ---------
  args must be a list of keyword-value containing required arguments
  to execute this function.
```

#### Queries with placeholders

**clsql** has support to placeholders. Defining them in your SQL allows
generated functions to safely replace them into generated queries, and also
to perform validations on whether required parameters are provided when invoking
such functions. Let's keep working on our `users.sql` file by adding a new
query:

```sql
--> activated-after
-- Returns all users activated after a given date.
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE activated_at >= :date
```

The query above declares a placeholder by using the `:NAME` notation. Let's
import it and see what happens:

```clojure
(require-query users :as users)

; require-query accepts :as and :refer, just like `require`. For more
; information, see require-query and require-queries documentation.
```

Now, let's try to invoke it without arguments and see how it behaves:

```clojure
=> (users/activated-after)
Execution error (IllegalArgumentException) at ...
Missing parameter(s): :date
```

The generated function knows a placeholder was defined, but not provided during
the invocation. Thus, an `IllegalArgumentException` was thrown. To fix it, let's
provide what it needs:

```clojure
=> (users/activated-after :date "2020-01-24")
...
```

### Passing Extra Options
Each query function exists in two forms, a simpler one, which takes either an
even number of arguments forming a map or none at all, and another one, with a
star (`*`) suffix, that take extra params. For instance, let's see documentation
for both versions of our `activated-after` function:

```clojure
=> (doc users/activated-after)
-------------------------
myapplication.some-namespace/activated-after
([& args*])
  Returns all users activated after a given date.

  Required arg: :date

  Arguments
  ---------
  args must be a list of keyword-value containing required arguments
  to execute this function.


=> (doc users/activated-after*)
-------------------------
myapplication.some-namespace/activated-after*
([db args? & opts*])
  Returns all users activated after a given date.

  Required arg: :date

  Arguments
  ---------
  db must be a database spec or transaction, as defined by clojure.jdbc
  args must be a map of required arguments for this query, or nil
  opts may be a list of options to be passed to clojure.jdbc
```

One can note major differences between those functions by only analysing their
arguments; The simpler one wants an arbitrary number of arguments, whilst the
second one wants a `db`, `args` and `opts`. While one may almost always use
the non-star function, the second may come handy in case a different database
than the one defined by `database-configuration` needs to be accessed.
`db` must be a db-spec structure just like one would use with
[`clojure.java.jdbc`](https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc). It can
alternativelly be a transaction, obtained from
[`with-db-transaction`](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/using_sql.html#using-transactions).
